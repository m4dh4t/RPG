Orientation.java :
	- getCode(Orientation orientation), used in ARPGPlayer :
	We added this method because we were having a bug letting the player
	orientate when it would not be natural to do so. If the player was
	facing a wall and holding down the key in the wall direction (f. ex.
	the left arrow when facing a wall to the left) and pressed another
	arrow key (f.ex. up) he would orientate to that direction without
	moving. By adding this method, it is now impossible to do so, you
	are stuck in the direction of the wall and you cannot orientate.

RPGSprite.java :
	Every method added in RPGSprite.java is used to facilitate the
	animations.
	- extractSprites(String name, int nbFrames, float width, float height, 
	Positionable parent, int regionWidth, int regionHeight), used in
	Coin.java, FireSpell.java, Grass.java, Heart.java, MagicWaterProjectile.java,
	Waterfall.java :
	This method is useful when the entity linked to the sprites does not
	have a specific orientation (or at least, the sprite does not change
	even if the orientation does). Each of the classes that use this
	method have their orientation independent of the sprites.

	- extractSprites(String name, int nbFrames, float width, float height,
	Positionable parent, int heightOfRegion, int regionWidth, int regionHeight),
	used in Orb.java :
	This method is useful if the sprites we want is not at the top of the
	image. It allows us to choose the height of the region.

	- extractSprites(String name, int nbFrames, float width, float height,
	Positionable parent, int regionWidth, int regionHeight, Vector anchor),
	used in Bomb.java, Monster.java :
	This method is basically the same as the first one except we can add
	an anchor attribute.

	- extractVerticalSprites(String name, int nbFrames, float width,
	float height, Positionable parent, int regionWidth, int regionHeight,
	Vector anchor), used in LogMonster.java :
	This method is basically the same as the third one except it extracts
	the sprites vertically and not horizontally.

__________________________❄_NEW_CLASSES_AND_INTERFACES_❄______________________

You will find below each new class that we created. A brief description of the
class is given if it is part of an extension.


In arpg :
	- ARPG.java
	- ARPGBehavior.java
	- ARPGItem.java

In arpg/actor :
	- ARPGInventory.java
	- ARPGPlayer.java
	- ARPGPlayerStatusGUI.java
	- Arrow.java
	- Bomb.java
	- Bridge.java :
		Concrete realization of TriggerableEntity.java that modelizes the
		bridge found in Road that can be crossed only if the orb has been
		hit.
	- CastleDoor.java
	- CastleKey.java
	- Chest.java :
		Class representing the chest found in Temple that can be opened
		to receive items.
	- Coin.java
	- DarkLord.java
	- FireSpell.java
	- FlameSkull.java
	- Grass.java
	- Heart.java
	- King.java :
		Class representing the king found in Castle which can be talked to
		to finish the game.
	- LogMonster.java
	- MagicWaterProjectile.java
	- Orb.java :
		Class representing the orb that can be hit and if so, trigger the
		bridge, letting you cross the river in Road.
	- Shop.java :
		Class representing the shop found in Village where the player can
		buy items.
	- Sword.java
	- Waterfall.java :
		Class representing a waterfall. We created this class to modelize
		the waterfall in Road.

In arpg/area :
	- ARPGArea.java
	- Castle.java
	- Farm.java
	- Road.java
	- RoadCastle.java
	- RoadTemple.java
	- Temple.java
	- Village.java

In arpg/handler :
	- ARPGInteractionVisitor.java

In rpg :
	- InventoryItem.java
	- RPG.java

In rpg/actor :
	- CollectableAreaEntity.java
	- FlyableEntity.java
	- Inventory.java
	- InvincibleEntity.java :
		Interface representing an entity that can be invincible. Each
		subclasses will have to redefine the method isInvincible() to
		know when they are invincible.
	- Monster.java
	- Projectile.java
	- TriggerableEntity.java :
		Abstract class representing an area entity that can be triggered
		(and can have different behaviors depending on if it has actually
		been triggered). We added this method to generalize the Bridge
		class to an entity that can be triggered.		
	- Weapon.java :
		Abstract class representing a weapon. A weapon can be registered
		on a cell and will want a cell interaction.

_____________________________❄_CHOICES_OF_PACKAGES_❄__________________________

Most of our classes have been put in the arpg/actor package. Each class that is
not specific to an ARPG game has been put in the rpg or rpg/actor package. An
inventory item is not considered to be an actor because it does not update over
time and has been put in the rpg package. Every other non-ARPG class is in
rpg/actor. For the same reason, ARPGItem is in the arpg package and every other
class is in arpg/actor except the areas and the ARPG handler which have been
put in their packages respectively.


________________________❄_DIFFERENCES_WITH_THE_INSTRUCTIONS_❄__________________

We did everything as the guideline told us to do except for the health system.
Instead of representing each health point with a heart, we represented each
health point with a half-heart, that means that a heart represents two health
points. No difference is seen in-game, but we can manipulate integers instead
of floats in our code as a half-heart is 1 health point instead of 1/2.
